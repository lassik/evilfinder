# [*]number	description
#
# If the number is prefixed with '*', it is considered a 'proof'. In other
# words, as soon as the program manages to get to this number, the subject
# is considered to be proven evil. Pick only universally recognized, truly
# evil numbers (666, or the year US patent system was established). 
#
# Other numbers are used to reach the desired result. Use anything, dates,
# important numerological symbols, etc, etc.
#
# The description part should have less than +/- 100 chars and should describe
# the number in a manner that is suitable to follow the number in the sentence.
# For example, "the year Michael Jackson was born" or "the symbol of sin"
# are correct, "this is my favorite number" is not. Make the descriptions
# colorful and vivid, if possible. It's OK to combine elements of conspiration
# theories or such with the descriptions. Make sure that all descriptions
# and numbers are "evil". Don't include events or numbers that do not refer
# to any disasters, plagues, are related to very little known and boring
# facts, etc.
