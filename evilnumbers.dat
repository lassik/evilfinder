# [*]number	description
#
# If the number is prefixed with '*', it is considered a proof point. In other
# words, as soon as the program manages to get to this number, the subject
# is considered to be proven evil. Pick only universally recognized, truly
# evil numbers (666, etc).
#
# Other numbers are used to reach the desired result. Use anything reasonably
# recognizable - dates, important numerological symbols, etc, etc.
#
# The description part should be less than ~100 chars and needs to describe
# the number in a manner that can be incorporated into a sane sentence.
# For example, "the year Michael Jackson was born" or "the symbol of sin"
# are correct, "this is my favorite number" is not.
